### NTTDATA-BankingSystem
### Project Description

This project involves developing a basic banking system in Java that manages clients and their bank accounts. The system will implement functionalities for client registration, account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries. It will also apply specific business rules, such as preventing negative balances in savings accounts and imposing overdraft limits on checking accounts.

### System Features

- **Class Model**: UML diagrams to model the **Client** and **Bank Account** objects using Object-Oriented Programming principles.
- **Data Persistence**: In-memory implementation using structures like `HashMap` or `ArrayList` for basic operations (insert, select, and update).
- **Validations**: Business rules and client data validation (unique DNI, email format) and banking transaction checks.
- **Technologies Used**: Java 8 and 11.

### Project Requirements

- **Mandatory Functionality**: Creation of domain classes, in-memory or MySQL persistence management, and verification of data integrity and constraints.
- **Deliverables**: Class diagrams, optional SQL scripts, and the code hosted on a GitHub repository, with daily progress updates.
